# Installation

```sh
npm i @smallhillcz/routesjs
```

# Motivation

As far as I can say there is no NodeJS framework that would support:
 - Automatic named links generation for discoverable APIs based on defined routes (routes automatically appear in root API endpoint and individual documents' _links array)
 - Permission-based (what user can) and workflow-based (what is possible for document) based filtering of routes and links.
 - Access control based on roles and document properties allowing for checking against documents (if user has certain permission on a document) and filtering documents based on permission (which documents user has permission on)
 
 If you know about any, please let me know, I will gladly shut this down in a minute :)

# Examples

I will keep the examples updated at [routesjs.com](https://routesjs.com).
